# GCP Cloud Storage

## Buckets
A bucket is a fundamental storage container in Google Cloud Storage where data is stored. Buckets are globally unique within GCP and provide various configurations for location, storage class, and access control.

### Location
The location of a bucket determines where the data is stored physically and impacts latency and redundancy.
- **Regional**: Stores data in a single region, ideal for low-latency and high-performance needs.
- **Dual-Region**: Stores data across two regions for better availability and resilience.
- **Multi-Region**: Stores data across multiple locations for maximum availability and redundancy.

### Storage Class
Storage classes determine the cost, performance, and availability of stored data.
- **Standard**: Best for frequently accessed data with low-latency requirements.
- **Nearline**: Suitable for data accessed less than once a month, offering lower costs.
- **Coldline**: Designed for long-term storage of infrequently accessed data (accessed less than once a year).
- **Archive**: Best for long-term archival storage, providing the lowest cost but higher retrieval time.

### Control Access
GCP Cloud Storage provides multiple ways to manage access to buckets and objects:
- **IAM Policies**: Role-based access control (RBAC) using predefined and custom roles.
- **ACLs (Access Control Lists)**: Object-level permissions for fine-grained access control.
- **Signed URLs**: Temporary URLs that grant access to specific objects without requiring IAM roles.
- **Signed Policy Documents**: Provide a way to control what data can be uploaded to a bucket.

### Versioning
Versioning helps preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of an object within a bucket. It protects against accidental deletions and overwrites.
- When enabled, deleted or overwritten objects are retained as noncurrent versions.
- Useful for backup and recovery scenarios.
- Can be managed via lifecycle policies to delete old versions automatically.

### Retention Policy
A retention policy enforces a minimum retention period for objects in a bucket.
- Prevents deletion or modification of objects before the retention period expires.
- Helps with compliance and regulatory requirements.
- Can be configured with a specific duration (e.g., 30 days, 1 year, etc.).
- Objects under retention policy can only be deleted after the specified duration has passed.

### Cloud Storage Lifecycle
Cloud Storage Lifecycle rules allow automated management of objects based on defined conditions, optimizing storage costs and maintenance.
- **Transition Rules**: Automatically move objects to a different storage class (e.g., Standard to Nearline) based on the last access or modification date.
- **Expiration Rules**: Automatically delete objects after a specified period.
- **Noncurrent Version Cleanup**: Deletes older versions of objects when versioning is enabled.
- **Custom Rules**: Define policies based on object metadata, storage duration, or access patterns.
- Lifecycle policies help reduce costs by ensuring data is stored in the most cost-effective class while maintaining compliance.
