# Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by Google Cloud. It simplifies container orchestration, automates deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.

## Key Features:

1. **Fully Managed Kubernetes**: Automates cluster management, scaling, and maintenance.
2. **Auto-Scaling**:
   - **Cluster Autoscaler**: Adjusts the number of nodes automatically.
   - **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)**: Adjusts the number of pods based on CPU/memory utilization.
3. **High Availability**:
   - Multi-zone and regional clusters for redundancy.
   - Automated repairs and self-healing infrastructure.
4. **Integrated Security**:
   - IAM-based access control.
   - GKE Sandbox for workload isolation.
   - Binary Authorization for security policy enforcement.
5. **Networking & Load Balancing**:
   - Native integration with Google Cloud Load Balancing.
   - Internal and external load balancing for services.
   - Kubernetes Network Policies for traffic control.
6. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Works with Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy, and third-party CI/CD tools.
   - Supports GitOps workflows with tools like ArgoCD.
7. **Monitoring & Logging**:
   - Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging for real-time insights.
   - Stackdriver integration for logging, tracing, and error reporting.
8. **Hybrid & Multi-Cloud Support**:
   - Anthos integration for managing clusters across different environments.
   - Kubernetes Federation for multi-cluster management.
9. **Stateful Workloads Support**:
   - PersistentVolumes and StatefulSets for database and storage needs.
10. **Serverless Workload Support**:
   - Cloud Run for GKE to run stateless applications in a serverless manner.

## GKE Cluster Types:

1. **Zonal Cluster**: A single-zone deployment, best for cost-sensitive applications.
2. **Regional Cluster**: Multi-zone deployment for high availability.
3. **Autopilot Cluster**: Fully automated Kubernetes management with optimized cost and scaling.

## Deployment Steps:

### 1. Install Google Cloud SDK
   ```sh
   gcloud components install kubectl
   ```

### 2. Create a GKE Cluster
   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters create my-cluster --zone us-central1-a
   ```

### 3. Authenticate with the Cluster
   ```sh
   gcloud container clusters get-credentials my-cluster --zone us-central1-a
   ```

### 4. Deploy an Application
   ```sh
   kubectl create deployment my-app --image=gcr.io/my-project/my-app:v1
   ```

### 5. Expose the Application
   ```sh
   kubectl expose deployment my-app --type=LoadBalancer --port=80 --target-port=8080
   ```

### 6. Get Service Details
   ```sh
   kubectl get services my-app
   ```

### 7. Scale the Application
   ```sh
   kubectl scale deployment my-app --replicas=3
   ```

### 8. Monitor Pods and Logs
   ```sh
   kubectl get pods
   kubectl logs -f my-app-pod
   ```

## Best Practices:

- **Use Autopilot for Cost Optimization**: GKE Autopilot manages infrastructure automatically.
- **Implement RBAC & IAM Policies**: Restrict access to Kubernetes resources.
- **Enable Auto-Scaling**: Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Cluster Autoscaler.
- **Use ConfigMaps & Secrets**: Manage configuration and sensitive data securely.
- **Leverage Helm Charts**: Simplify application deployment with Helm.
- **Monitor & Log Efficiently**: Use Cloud Monitoring and Logging for insights.
- **Secure Networking**: Enforce Network Policies and restrict public access.

GKE provides a powerful, scalable, and managed Kubernetes experience, making it an ideal choice for deploying containerized applications. ðŸš€
