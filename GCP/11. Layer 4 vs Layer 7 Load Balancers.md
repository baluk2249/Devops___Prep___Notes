# Layer 4 vs Layer 7 Load Balancers

## OSI Model Context

* **Layer 4**: Transport Layer (TCP/UDP)
* **Layer 7**: Application Layer (HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, etc.)

---

## 🌐 Layer 4 Load Balancer (Transport Layer)

### ▶ What it does:

* Routes traffic based on **IP address and TCP/UDP ports**
* Operates at the **transport level**
* Blind to application-level data (URLs, cookies, etc.)

### 📦 Example Decisions:

* Client IP ➞ TCP port 443 ➞ Backend 1
* Client IP ➞ UDP port 53 ➞ Backend 2

### ✅ Pros:

* Fast and lightweight (no need to inspect HTTP headers)
* Suitable for any TCP/UDP-based protocol (e.g., SMTP, FTP, custom apps)

### ❌ Cons:

* No application-level logic (can’t route based on paths, headers)
* No SSL offloading unless combined with a reverse proxy

### 💡 Common Tools:

* **AWS Network Load Balancer**
* **GCP Network Load Balancer**
* **HAProxy (TCP mode)**

## 🌍 Layer 7 Load Balancer (Application Layer)

### ▶ What it does:

* Routes traffic based on **application-layer data**, like:

  * URL paths (`/api`, `/images`)
  * Hostnames (`api.example.com`)
  * HTTP headers or cookies
* Understands protocols like **HTTP/HTTPS**

### 📦 Example Decisions:

* `example.com/api/*` ➞ App server 1
* `example.com/images/*` ➞ CDN or image server

### ✅ Pros:

* Smart routing and content-based rules
* SSL termination/offloading
* Can rewrite URLs or headers
* Good for microservices and modern web apps

### ❌ Cons:

* Slightly higher latency than L4 (due to deeper packet inspection)
* Limited to application-level protocols (usually HTTP/HTTPS)

### 💡 Common Tools:

* **AWS Application Load Balancer**
* **GCP HTTP(S) Load Balancer**
* **NGINX, HAProxy (HTTP mode)**
* **Traefik, Envoy, Istio**

## 🧪 Example Use Cases

### Layer 4:

* Load balance MySQL (TCP 3306)
* Game servers (UDP)
* SMTP mail routing

### Layer 7:

* Route `/api` to microservice A and `/shop` to B
* Terminate SSL and forward traffic internally as HTTP
* A/B testing or canary deployments based on cookies
