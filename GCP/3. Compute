# GCP Compute Services

## 1. Compute Engine
Google Compute Engine (GCE) is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering that provides scalable virtual machines (VMs) in Google Cloud.

### Features:
- Predefined and custom machine types
- Persistent disks and local SSDs
- Automatic scaling and load balancing
- Live migration and preemptible VMs
- Security with IAM and VPC firewall rules
- Integration with Kubernetes, AI/ML, and data services

### Use Cases:
- Hosting applications and websites
- Running containerized applications with Kubernetes
- High-performance computing (HPC) workloads
- Data processing and analytics

## 2. Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
Google Kubernetes Engine is a managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications.

### Features:
- Fully managed Kubernetes clusters
- Auto-scaling for nodes and workloads
- Automatic upgrades and patching
- Integrated logging and monitoring
- Support for multi-cluster and hybrid deployments
- Enhanced security with IAM and workload identity

### Use Cases:
