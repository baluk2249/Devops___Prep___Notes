# Google Cloud Armor

Google Cloud Armor is a web application and DDoS protection service that helps secure applications deployed on Google Cloud. It provides security policies, adaptive protection, and integrates with Google Cloud Load Balancers.

## Key Features:

1. **DDoS Protection**:
   - Protects against volumetric and application-layer DDoS attacks.
   - Leverages Google's global infrastructure for mitigation.
2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**:
   - Provides preconfigured and customizable security rules.
   - Defends against OWASP Top 10 threats such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
3. **Adaptive Protection**:
   - Uses machine learning to detect and mitigate emerging threats.
   - Provides real-time alerts for suspicious traffic.
4. **IP Allow/Deny Lists**:
   - Restrict or allow traffic based on IP addresses and CIDR ranges.
5. **Geo-Based Access Control**:
   - Block or allow traffic based on geographical regions.
6. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Prevents abuse by setting request rate limits for specific clients.
7. **Security Policy Enforcement**:
   - Applies security policies to backend services through Cloud Load Balancers.
8. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Integrates with Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for visibility.
9. **Integration with Google Cloud Services**:
   - Works seamlessly with Cloud Load Balancing, Cloud Run, GKE, and App Engine.
10. **Threat Intelligence**:
   - Uses Google Threat Intelligence to block known malicious IPs and attack patterns.

## Use Cases:

- **Protect Web Applications**: Prevent attacks on applications hosted on GCP.
- **DDoS Mitigation**: Defend against large-scale denial-of-service attacks.
- **Compliance & Security**: Enforce security policies for regulatory compliance.
- **Geo-Blocking**: Restrict access based on country or region.
- **API Security**: Protect APIs from abuse and exploitation.

## Deployment Steps:

### 1. Enable Cloud Armor
   ```sh
   gcloud services enable cloudarmor.googleapis.com
   ```

### 2. Create a Security Policy
   ```sh
   gcloud compute security-policies create my-security-policy
   ```

### 3. Add a Rule to Block Traffic from a Specific Country
   ```sh
   gcloud compute security-policies rules create 1000 \
     --security-policy=my-security-policy \
     --expression="origin.region_code == 'CN'" \
     --action=deny
   ```

### 4. Allow Only Specific IP Ranges
   ```sh
   gcloud compute security-policies rules create 2000 \
     --security-policy=my-security-policy \
     --expression="inIpRange(origin.ip, '192.168.1.0/24')" \
     --action=allow
   ```

### 5. Enable Rate Limiting
   ```sh
   gcloud compute security-policies rules create 3000 \
     --security-policy=my-security-policy \
     --expression="true" \
     --action=throttle \
     --rate-limit-threshold-count=100 \
     --rate-limit-threshold-interval-sec=60
   ```

### 6. Apply Security Policy to a Load Balancer
   ```sh
   gcloud compute backend-services update my-backend-service \
     --security-policy=my-security-policy
   ```

### 7. Monitor Logs
   ```sh
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=global AND protoPayload.serviceName=cloudarmor.googleapis.com" --limit 10
   ```

## Best Practices:

- **Use Adaptive Protection**: Detect anomalies using machine learning.
- **Apply Geo-Based Restrictions**: Reduce unwanted traffic by blocking specific regions.
- **Enable Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse from high-frequency requests.
- **Monitor Security Logs**: Regularly check Cloud Logging for suspicious activity.
- **Test Rules Before Deployment**: Use preview mode to evaluate policy effects.
- **Combine with Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP)**: Strengthen authentication and access control.

Google Cloud Armor provides a robust security solution to protect cloud-hosted applications against threats, ensuring better availability and compliance. ðŸš€
