# GCP Compute Services

## 1. Compute Engine
Google Compute Engine (GCE) is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering that provides scalable virtual machines (VMs) in Google Cloud.

### Features:
- **Predefined and Custom Machine Types**: Offers standard, high-memory, high-CPU, and GPU-enabled machine types.
- **Persistent Disks and Local SSDs**: Supports different storage types including standard and SSD persistent disks, as well as high-performance local SSDs.
- **Auto-scaling and Load Balancing**: Automatically scales instances up and down based on demand and integrates with load balancers.
- **Live Migration**: Keeps VMs running even during maintenance events.
- **Preemptible VMs & Spot VMs**: Cost-effective options for fault-tolerant workloads.
- **Security**:
  - IAM for access control
  - VPC firewall rules
  - Confidential Computing for enhanced data protection
- **Integration**:
  - Kubernetes, AI/ML, and data processing tools
  - Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and other GCP services

### Networking:
- **VPC Networks & Subnets**: Configurable network topology with private and public IPs.
- **Cloud Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across instances.
- **Cloud NAT**: Allows instances to access the internet securely.
- **Interconnect & VPN**: Private connectivity between on-premises and GCP.

### Disk & Storage Options:
- **Persistent Disks** (Standard & SSD): Durable and auto-replicated storage.
- **Local SSDs**: High IOPS storage for low-latency workloads.
- **Filestore**: Managed file storage service.
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Object storage for scalable data storage.

### Security & Compliance:
- **Shielded VMs**: Protection against rootkits and firmware attacks.
- **Confidential VMs**: Encryption-in-use for sensitive workloads.
- **OS Patching & Compliance**: Automatic patching and security updates.
- **IAM & Service Accounts**: Fine-grained access control.

### Management & Automation:
- **Instance Groups**: Managed and unmanaged instance groups for scalable applications.
- **Startup Scripts & Metadata**: Custom initialization scripts.
- **Terraform & Deployment Manager**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automation.
- **Billing & Cost Optimization**:
  - Sustained-use discounts
  - Committed-use contracts
  - Autoscaler for cost efficiency
