# Docker Networking

## **1. What is Docker Networking?**
Docker networking enables communication between containers, host systems, and external networks. It allows containers to communicate securely and efficiently, supporting various use cases like microservices, distributed applications, and database interactions.

---

## **2. Why is Docker Networking Important?**
- **Container Communication**: Enables containers to talk to each other.
- **Host Communication**: Allows containers to interact with the host machine.
- **External Access**: Connects containers to the internet.
- **Security & Isolation**: Provides network segmentation and isolation.
- **Scalability**: Supports dynamic service discovery and scaling.

# **3. Types of Docker Networks**
Docker provides different networking drivers, each suited for specific use cases.

| Network Type | Isolation | Supports Multi-host? | Use Case |
|-------------|----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Bridge**  | Medium   | ❌ No  | Default for standalone containers |
| **Host**    | Low      | ❌ No  | Performance optimization |
| **Overlay** | High     | ✅ Yes | Multi-host Swarm communication |
| **Macvlan** | High     | ✅ Yes | Assigns MAC addresses, useful for direct communication |
| **None**    | High     | ❌ No  | Disables networking |

## **4. Bridge Network (Default)**
### **4.1 What is a Bridge Network?**
- Default network for containers.
- Allows inter-container communication on the same host.
- Uses NAT (Network Address Translation) to connect to the internet.

### **4.2 Listing Available Networks**
```bash
docker network ls
```

### **4.3 Creating a Bridge Network**
```bash
docker network create my_bridge
```

### **4.4 Running Containers on a Bridge Network**
```bash
docker run -d --name container1 --network my_bridge busybox sleep 3600
docker run -d --name container2 --network my_bridge busybox sleep 3600
```

### **4.5 Checking Network Details**
```bash
docker network inspect my_bridge
```

---

## **5. Host Network**
### **5.1 What is the Host Network?**
- Removes network isolation.
- Container shares the host's network stack.
- Useful for performance-sensitive applications.

### **5.2 Running a Container in Host Network**
```bash
docker run -d --name host_container --network host nginx
```

---

## **6. Overlay Network (For Swarm Mode)**
### **6.1 What is an Overlay Network?**
- Used in **Docker Swarm** for multi-host networking.
- Allows containers across multiple hosts to communicate.

### **6.2 Creating an Overlay Network**
```bash
docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay
```

### **6.3 Deploying a Service on Overlay Network**
```bash
docker service create --name my_service --network my_overlay nginx
```

---

## **7. Macvlan Network**
### **7.1 What is Macvlan?**
- Assigns a **real MAC address** to each container.
- Makes containers appear as physical devices on the network.

### **7.2 Creating a Macvlan Network**
```bash
docker network create -d macvlan \
  --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
  --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
  -o parent=eth0 my_macvlan
```

### **7.3 Running a Container in Macvlan**
```bash
docker run -d --name macvlan_container --network my_macvlan busybox sleep 3600
```

---

## **8. None Network (Isolated Mode)**
### **8.1 What is None Network?**
- Disables networking.
- Used for security and testing isolated environments.

### **8.2 Running a Container with No Networking**
```bash
docker run -d --name no_network_container --network none busybox sleep 3600
```

---

## **9. Exposing and Publishing Ports**
### **9.1 Exposing a Port to Other Containers**
```bash
docker run -d --name webserver --network my_bridge -p 8080:80 nginx
```

### **9.2 Accessing the Container**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

---

## **10. Connecting a Container to Multiple Networks**
```bash
docker network create net1
docker network create net2
docker run -d --name multi_net_container --network net1 busybox sleep 3600
docker network connect net2 multi_net_container
```

---

## **11. Removing Docker Networks**
### **11.1 Removing a Network**
```bash
docker network rm my_bridge
```

### **11.2 Removing All Unused Networks**
```bash
docker network prune
```

---

## **12. Inspecting and Debugging Networks**
### **12.1 Inspecting a Specific Network**
```bash
docker network inspect bridge
```

### **12.2 Finding the IP Address of a Container**
```bash
docker inspect -f '{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' container1
```

### **12.3 Testing Network Connectivity**
```bash
docker exec -it container1 ping container2
```

# **13. Best Practices for Docker Networking**
✅ Use **Bridge Networks** for standalone applications.  
✅ Use **Overlay Networks** for multi-host deployments.  
✅ Use **Macvlan** if containers need unique IP addresses.  
✅ Avoid **Host Network** unless necessary for performance.  
✅ Secure networks by **limiting unnecessary connectivity**.  
✅ Regularly **prune unused networks** for cleanup.  

---

# **14. Conclusion**
Docker networking is a crucial aspect of containerized applications, ensuring efficient communication between containers, hosts, and external services. Choosing the right network type depends on your use case—**bridge for standalone containers, overlay for Swarm, and Macvlan for direct network access**.
