# Containers in Linux and Namespaces

## **What is a Container in Linux?**  
A **container** is a lightweight, portable, and isolated runtime environment that packages an application and its dependencies together. Containers share the same OS kernel but have isolated user space, achieved using **namespaces** and **cgroups**.

### **Key Technologies Behind Containers**
1. **Namespaces** – Provide process isolation.
2. **cgroups (Control Groups)** – Manage resource allocation (CPU, memory, etc.).
3. **Union Filesystems** – Enable efficient storage layers (e.g., OverlayFS).
4. **Seccomp and Capabilities** – Restrict container privileges for security.

## **Namespaces in Linux**
Namespaces are a fundamental feature that enables process isolation in Linux. Each namespace provides a different aspect of isolation. 

### **Types of Namespaces**
1. **PID Namespace (Process Isolation)**  
   - Each container has its own PID namespace.
   - A process in one container cannot see or interact with processes in another container.

2. **Mount Namespace (Filesystem Isolation)**  
   - Each container can have its own mount points.
   - It prevents containers from accessing the host filesystem directly.

3. **UTS Namespace (Hostname Isolation)**  
   - Allows each container to have its own hostname.
   - Useful for setting unique hostnames inside containers.

4. **IPC Namespace (Inter-Process Communication Isolation)**  
   - Controls shared memory and message queues between processes.
   - Ensures processes in one container cannot interfere with those in another.

5. **Network Namespace (Network Stack Isolation)**  
   - Provides each container with its own network stack (interfaces, routes, etc.).
   - Containers can have separate IP addresses and network interfaces.

6. **User Namespace (User Privilege Isolation)**  
   - Allows containers to have different user/group mappings than the host.
   - Provides better security by letting processes run as non-root inside the container while appearing as root inside.

## **What Are cgroups in Linux?**  
**cgroups** (Control Groups) in Linux are a kernel feature that allows you to limit, prioritize, allocate, and monitor system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc.) for a group of processes. cgroups ensure that one process or container does not consume excessive resources, leading to system instability.

### **Key Features of cgroups**
1. **Resource Limiting** – Restrict how much CPU, memory, or disk I/O a process can use.
2. **Resource Allocation** – Assign a specific amount of resources to processes.
3. **Process Prioritization** – Ensure important processes get higher CPU shares.
4. **Process Freezing and Throttling** – Suspend or slow down a group of processes.
5. **Monitoring and Accounting** – Track resource usage of processes.

## **cgroups Versions**
There are two versions of cgroups:
- **cgroups v1** – Has a hierarchical structure with multiple controllers.
- **cgroups v2** – Provides a unified and simplified hierarchy.

Most modern Linux distributions use **cgroups v2**.

---

## **Major cgroup Controllers (Subsystems)**
Each cgroup controller manages a specific resource type:

| **Controller** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|
| **cpu** | Limits CPU usage for processes. |
| **cpuacct** | Tracks CPU usage. |
| **memory** | Limits and monitors memory usage. |
| **blkio** | Controls disk I/O. |
| **net_cls / net_prio** | Manages network bandwidth. |
| **devices** | Restricts access to devices (e.g., block devices, USB). |
| **pids** | Limits the number of processes in a group. |
| **freezer** | Freezes or resumes processes. |

---

## **How cgroups Work**
1. **Create a cgroup** – A new directory is created under `/sys/fs/cgroup/` for each resource type.
2. **Assign processes** – Processes are added to a cgroup by writing their PID to the `cgroup.procs` file.
3. **Apply resource limits** – Limits are set using specific files in the cgroup directory.

---

## **Example: Creating a cgroup to Limit CPU Usage**
1. **Create a new cgroup**
   ```bash
   mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/my_cgroup
   ```
2. **Limit CPU usage to 50%** (assuming cgroups v1)
   ```bash
   echo 50000 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/my_cgroup/cpu.cfs_quota_us
   ```
3. **Add a process (PID 1234) to the cgroup**
   ```bash
   echo 1234 > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/my_cgroup/cgroup.procs
   ```

For **cgroups v2**, the process is similar but uses a unified hierarchy.

---

## **How Containers Use cgroups**
Container runtimes like **Docker, Kubernetes, and systemd** use cgroups to enforce resource constraints.  
For example:
- When running a container with Docker:
  ```bash
  docker run --memory=512m --cpus=1 ubuntu
  ```
  - This enforces a **512MB memory limit** and **1 CPU core** using cgroups.

---

### **Conclusion**
cgroups play a crucial role in **containerization, process isolation, and resource management**. They ensure that applications do not interfere with each other by consuming excessive system resources.
