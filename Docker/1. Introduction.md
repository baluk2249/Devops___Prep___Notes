# Docker

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure, allowing you to deliver software quickly.

## Key Features
- Open-source and written in Go language.
- Based on containerization.
- Several applications can run independently.

## Docker Architecture
Docker follows a client-server architecture consisting of several key components:

- **Docker Client**: The user interface (CLI) to interact with the Docker daemon.
- **Docker Daemon**: A background service that manages Docker objects like images, containers, and networks.
- **Docker Engine**: The core of Docker, responsible for building and running containers.
- **Docker Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
- **Docker Registry**: A storage and distribution system for Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).
- **Docker Container**: A runtime instance of a Docker image that contains everything needed to run an application.

## Types of Containers
- **Interactive Containers**: Containers that run interactively, allowing users to execute commands inside the container (e.g., `docker run -it <image>`).
- **Daemonized Containers**: Containers that run in the background (detached mode) using `-d` flag (e.g., `docker run -d <image>`).

## Lifecycle of a Docker Container
1. **Pull an Image**: `docker pull <image>`
2. **Run a Container**: `docker run <image>`
3. **List Running Containers**: `docker ps`
4. **List All Containers**: `docker ps -a`
5. **Stop a Container**: `docker stop <container_id>`
6. **Restart a Container**: `docker restart <container_id>`
7. **Remove a Container**: `docker rm <container_id>`
8. **Remove an Image**: `docker rmi <image_id>`
9. **Commit Changes**: `docker commit <container_id> <new_image_name>`

Docker simplifies application deployment by providing an efficient way to package and distribute software in a consistent environment.
