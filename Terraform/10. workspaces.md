# Terraform Workspaces 
## What is a Terraform Workspace?

A **workspace** in Terraform allows you to manage multiple states for a single configuration. This is useful when you want to reuse the same Terraform code across different environments without duplicating the configuration.

---

## Key Concepts

- Each workspace has its own **state file**.
- The **default** workspace is always present.
- Useful for **environment segregation** (e.g., dev, staging, prod).
- Workspaces work best with **remote backends** (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB).

## CLI Commands

| Command                            | Description                                 |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `terraform workspace list`        | List all workspaces                         |
| `terraform workspace new <name>`  | Create a new workspace                      |
| `terraform workspace select <name>` | Switch to an existing workspace            |
| `terraform workspace show`        | Show the current workspace                  |
| `terraform workspace delete <name>` | Delete a workspace                         |

## Example 1: Create and Use Workspaces

```bash
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace select dev
terraform workspace show
```

This creates two environments (`dev` and `prod`) and selects `dev` for operations.

---

## Example 2: Use Workspace Name in Resource Naming

```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "env_bucket" {
  name     = "my-app-${terraform.workspace}"
  location = "US"
}
```

This creates a bucket with a name like `my-app-dev` or `my-app-prod` depending on the active workspace.

---

## Example 3: Conditional Logic Based on Workspace

```hcl
locals {
  region = terraform.workspace == "prod" ? "us-central1" : "us-east1"
}

provider "google" {
  project = "my-gcp-project"
  region  = local.region
}
```

The `region` is dynamically selected based on the current workspace.

---

## Example 4: Workspace-Specific State with Remote Backend (S3)

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-states"
    key            = "project-name/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  }
}
```

Terraform appends the workspace name to the `key` automatically:
- `default` → `project-name/terraform.tfstate`
- `dev` → `project-name/dev/terraform.tfstate`
- `prod` → `project-name/prod/terraform.tfstate`

---

## When to Use Workspaces

- Managing **multiple environments** (dev/staging/prod) using the **same codebase**.
- You want **environment isolation** without copying configuration files.
- You're using **remote backends** and want separate state management.

---

## When NOT to Use Workspaces

- For **multi-region** or **multi-account** deployments — use **separate configurations** or **Terragrunt**.
- When environments require **substantial configuration differences**.

---

## Best Practices

- Always initialize a workspace before applying changes.
- Keep workspace naming consistent (`dev`, `qa`, `prod`).
- Store workspace-specific values in variables or locals.
- Combine workspaces with CI/CD workflows for automation.
