# Terraform Locals

## What are `locals` in Terraform?

`locals` are named values that you can define within a Terraform configuration. They help simplify complex expressions and avoid repetition.

Use locals to:

* Abstract repeated logic
* Make configurations more readable
* Centralize computed values

---

## Syntax

```hcl
locals {
  name      = "dev"
  region    = "us-west-2"
  full_name = "${local.name}-example"
}
```

You can reference a local value using `local.<name>`:

```hcl
output "env" {
  value = local.name
}
```

---

## Example 1: Using locals for repeated values

```hcl
locals {
  environment = "production"
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = local.instance_type
  tags = {
    Environment = local.environment
  }
}
```

---

## Example 2: Locals with expressions and functions

```hcl
locals {
  region          = "us-east-1"
  availability_zones = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b"]
  subnet_names    = [for az in local.availability_zones : "subnet-${az}"]
}

output "subnets" {
  value = local.subnet_names
}
```

---

## Example 3: Using locals to simplify conditionals

```hcl
variable "is_prod" {
  type    = bool
  default = false
}

locals {
  instance_type = var.is_prod ? "t3.large" : "t3.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web" {
  ami           = "ami-123456"
  instance_type = local.instance_type
}
```

---

## Best Practices

* Use `locals` to avoid copy-pasting values
* Name locals descriptively for better clarity
* Combine with functions, conditionals, and for-expressions
* Organize logically to improve maintainability

---

Using `locals` improves readability, reduces duplication, and simplifies complex expressions in Terraform configurations.
