# Terraform CLI Commands

Terraform provides a command-line interface (CLI) that lets you manage your infrastructure using various commands.

---

## `terraform init`

Initializes a Terraform working directory. Downloads provider plugins and sets up backend.

```bash
terraform init
```

**Use case:** Run once per configuration before applying.

---

## `terraform plan`

Shows what actions Terraform will take to apply changes.

```bash
terraform plan
```

**Flags:**

* `-out=planfile`: Save the plan to a file
* `-var="key=value"`: Override variable value

---

## `terraform apply`

Applies the changes required to reach the desired state.

```bash
terraform apply
```

**Flags:**

* `planfile`: Use a saved plan file
* `-auto-approve`: Skip interactive approval

Example:

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

## `terraform destroy`

Destroys all resources managed by Terraform.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Flags:**

* `-auto-approve`: Skip confirmation prompt

---

## `terraform validate`

Validates the configuration files for syntax and internal consistency.

```bash
terraform validate
```

---

## `terraform fmt`

Formats Terraform code using canonical style.

```bash
terraform fmt
```

**Use case:** Auto-format code in CI/CD or before commits.

---

## `terraform output`

Displays outputs from the last applied configuration.

```bash
terraform output
terraform output <output_name>
```

---

## `terraform show`

Shows the current state or a saved plan file.

```bash
terraform show
terraform show terraform.tfstate
```

---

## `terraform state`

Advanced command to inspect or modify the state.

```bash
terraform state list
terraform state show <resource>
```

---

## `terraform taint`

Marks a resource to be destroyed and recreated on next apply.

```bash
terraform taint aws_instance.example
```

---

## `terraform untaint`

Removes the taint from a resource.

```bash
terraform untaint aws_instance.example
```

---

## `terraform import`

Imports existing infrastructure into Terraform management.

```bash
terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
```

---

## `terraform graph`

Outputs a DOT graph of the configuration.

```bash
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
```

---

## `terraform providers`

Lists all required providers and their versions.

```bash
terraform providers
```

---

## Best Practices

* Always run `terraform plan` before `apply`
* Format code with `terraform fmt`
* Validate configs before pushing changes
* Use state subcommands with caution

---

The Terraform CLI is essential for managing infrastructure as code and forms the foundation of every Terraform workflow.
