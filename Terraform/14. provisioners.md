# Terraform Provisioners ‚Äì Detailed Notes

---

## ‚ú© What Are Terraform Provisioners?

Provisioners in Terraform are used to execute scripts or commands on a **local** or **remote** machine **after** a resource is created or destroyed.  
They allow for **bootstrapping**, **configuration**, and **custom setup** during infrastructure deployment.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Provisioners are a last resort. Terraform encourages using infrastructure as code through tools like **Ansible**, **Cloud-Init**, or **Packer** for provisioning logic.

---

## ‚ú© Types of Provisioners

Terraform supports two main types:

### 1. `local-exec`
Executes a command **on the machine where Terraform is run** (your local workstation or CI/CD agent).

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo ${self.triggers.message} > message.txt"
  }

  triggers = {
    message = "Hello from Terraform!"
  }
}
```

### 2. `remote-exec`
Executes commands **on the remote resource** (e.g., a VM via SSH or WinRM).

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "my-key"

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt-get update",
      "sudo apt-get install -y nginx"
    ]
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ú© Connection Block (for `remote-exec`)

### SSH (Linux):
```hcl
connection {
  type        = "ssh"
  user        = "ubuntu"
  private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
  host        = self.public_ip
}
```

### WinRM (Windows):
```hcl
connection {
  type     = "winrm"
  user     = "Administrator"
  password = "Password123"
  host     = self.public_ip
}
```

---

## ‚ú© `null_resource` with Provisioners

A `null_resource` is a dummy resource used to run provisioners without depending on a real infrastructure resource.

```hcl
resource "null_resource" "example" {
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "echo Deploying..."
  }

  triggers = {
    always_run = "${timestamp()}"
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ú© `file` Provisioner

Used to **copy files or directories** from local to remote machine.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # ...
  provisioner "file" {
    source      = "myapp.conf"
    destination = "/etc/myapp.conf"
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}
```

---

## ‚ú© `when` Argument

Used to control **when** a provisioner runs.

- `create` ‚Äì (default) runs after resource creation
- `destroy` ‚Äì runs before resource is destroyed

```hcl
provisioner "local-exec" {
  when    = "destroy"
  command = "echo Resource is being destroyed"
}
```

---

## ‚úÖ Use Cases

- Initializing instances (e.g., installing software)
- Copying configuration files
- Bootstrapping apps
- Triggering scripts during destroy
- Invoking external notification systems

---

## üö´ When NOT to Use Provisioners

Avoid if:
- Configuration can be done via cloud-init, Ansible, etc.
- You're relying on provisioners for production-critical steps.
- Provisioner failures would cause Terraform to behave inconsistently.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Best Practices

- Prefer **idempotent scripts**.
- Use **retry and timeout** options if the command might fail transiently.
- Avoid overusing provisioners ‚Äì prefer immutable infrastructure.
- Use `null_resource` when you don‚Äôt want to tie a script to a real resource.
- Always handle errors and validate outputs in your scripts.

---

## üîÑ Retry / Timeout Options

```hcl
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo systemctl restart nginx"
  ]

  on_failure    = "continue"  # or "fail"
  timeout       = "5m"
  retries       = 3
  retry_interval = "30s"
}
```

---

## üóíÔ∏è Troubleshooting

- Use `TF_LOG=DEBUG` to debug issues
- Confirm SSH/WinRM connectivity
- Ensure proper permissions for user
- Use `triggers` block in `null_resource` to re-run provisioners when needed

## üìù Summary Table

| Type         | Runs On     | Use Case                        |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| `local-exec` | Local Host  | Trigger CI/CD tools, log files  |
| `remote-exec`| Remote Host | Bootstrap remote instances      |
| `file`       | Remote Host | Copy files to remote machine    |
| `null_resource` | N/A     | Run provisioners independently  |
