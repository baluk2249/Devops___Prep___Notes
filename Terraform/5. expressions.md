# Terraform Expressions

## What are Expressions in Terraform?

Expressions in Terraform are used to compute or retrieve values dynamically. They can be simple (like a string or a number) or complex (like referencing resources, using conditionals, or for loops).

## Types of Expressions

### 1. **Literals**

```hcl
"hello"        # string
123            # number
true, false    # boolean
[1, 2, 3]      # list
{"key" = "val"} # map
```

---

### 2. **References**

Used to refer to variables, resources, data sources, etc.

```hcl
var.region
aws_instance.web.id
data.aws_ami.latest.id
```

---

### 3. **Interpolation Syntax**

Interpolation is used to embed expressions inside strings using `${}`.

```hcl
"Instance ID: ${aws_instance.web.id}"
```

From Terraform 0.12+, you can usually omit `${}` for simple expressions:

```hcl
"Instance ID: aws_instance.web.id"
```

---

### 4. **Conditionals (Ternary Expressions)**

Used to conditionally choose values:

```hcl
var.is_prod ? "t3.medium" : "t2.micro"
```

---

### 5. **Built-in Functions**

Examples:

```hcl
length(var.subnets)       # Count of items in list
lower("Hello")            # Convert to lowercase
join(",", ["a", "b"])     # Join list with comma
lookup(var.map, "key")    # Look up value from map
```

---

### 6. **For Expressions**

Used to iterate and transform lists or maps.

```hcl
[for s in var.subnets : upper(s)]
```

Or to generate maps:

```hcl
{ for name in var.names : name => upper(name) }
```

---

### 7. **Dynamic Blocks with Expressions**

```hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example"

  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.rules
    content {
      from_port   = ingress.value.from_port
      to_port     = ingress.value.to_port
      protocol    = ingress.value.protocol
      cidr_blocks = ingress.value.cidr_blocks
    }
  }
}
```

---

### 8. **Splat Expressions**

Used when dealing with multiple resources (e.g., from `count` or `for_each`):

```hcl
aws_instance.web[*].id
```

---

## Best Practices for Using Expressions

* Avoid over-nesting complex interpolations
* Use `locals` to simplify long expressions
* Take advantage of built-in functions for cleaner code
* Use conditionals and `for` expressions for modular logic

Expressions and interpolation are core to writing DRY and dynamic Terraform configurations. Mastering them enables powerful infrastructure as code patterns.
