# Kubernetes Architecture

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform that automates deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications. Its architecture follows a master-slave model and is designed for high scalability, flexibility, and fault tolerance.

## 1. Kubernetes Cluster Components

A Kubernetes cluster consists of several key components, divided into two major sections:

* **Control Plane**: The brain of the Kubernetes cluster responsible for managing and controlling the entire system.
* **Node**: The machines that run the containers and workloads managed by Kubernetes.

## 2. Control Plane Components

The control plane is responsible for the global management of the cluster, ensuring that the desired state of the cluster matches the actual state. It comprises several components:

* **Kube-API Server**:

  * Acts as the entry point for all administrative tasks and communication with the cluster.
  * All requests are sent to the API server, which processes them and updates the state of the cluster.
  * Exposes a RESTful API for interacting with Kubernetes resources.
  * Stateless and scalable.

* **etcd**:

  * A distributed key-value store used to store all cluster data, including configuration and state.
  * Highly available and fault-tolerant.

* **Kube-Scheduler**:

  * Watches for unscheduled pods and assigns them to appropriate nodes.
  * Considers resources, constraints, and policies.

* **Kube-Controller-Manager**:

  * Runs various controllers that monitor cluster state and maintain the desired state.
  * Includes Node Controller, Replication Controller, Deployment Controller, etc.

* **Cloud Controller Manager**:

  * Optional component for integrating with cloud providers.
  * Handles cloud-specific tasks like load balancer and volume provisioning.

## 3. Node Components

Nodes in Kubernetes are physical or virtual machines that run the actual workloads. Each node contains:

* **Kubelet**:

  * Agent that runs on each node and ensures containers are running as expected.
  * Communicates with the API server.

* **Kube Proxy**:

  * Maintains network rules and allows communication between pods.
  * Manages virtual IPs and service traffic.

* **Container Runtime**:

  * Software responsible for running containers (e.g., Docker, containerd).

* **Pod**:

  * The smallest deployable unit.
  * May contain one or more containers with shared storage and network resources.

## 4. Kubernetes Networking

* **Pod Network**: Each pod gets a unique IP. All pods can communicate without NAT.
* **Service**: Stable endpoint for accessing a group of pods.
* **Ingress**: Manages external HTTP/HTTPS access to services.
* **Network Policies**: Define rules for traffic flow between pods.

## 5. Kubernetes Objects

* **Pod**: Represents an application instance.
* **Deployment**: Manages pod lifecycle and replicas.
* **ReplicaSet**: Ensures a set number of pod replicas.
* **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful apps with persistent identity and storage.
* **DaemonSet**: Ensures one pod runs per node.
* **Job**: Runs tasks to completion.
* **CronJob**: Runs jobs on a schedule.
* **Service**: Exposes pods to other pods or external users.
* **ConfigMap/Secret**: Manage configuration and sensitive data.
* **Namespace**: Isolate resources within a cluster.

## 6. Scheduler and Controllers

* **Scheduler**:

  * Assigns pods to suitable nodes based on constraints and availability.

* **Controllers**:

  * Ensure system maintains the desired state.
  * Include Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet controllers, etc.

## 7. Kubernetes Storage

* **Volumes**: Provide storage accessible to containers. Can be ephemeral or persistent.
* **Persistent Volume (PV)**: Represents provisioned storage.
* **Persistent Volume Claim (PVC)**: Requests for storage by users.
* **Storage Class**: Describes storage types and dynamic provisioning.

## 8. Kubernetes RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

* **Role**: Defines permissions within a namespace.
* **ClusterRole**: Defines permissions cluster-wide.
* **RoleBinding**: Assigns a Role to a user or service account in a namespace.
* **ClusterRoleBinding**: Assigns a ClusterRole at the cluster level.

## 9. Kubernetes API

* **API Server** is the primary interface.
* Exposes REST API for managing resources.
* Supports communication between all components and external tools.

## 10. Kubernetes Ecosystem Tools

* **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes.
* **Istio**: Service mesh for traffic management and security.
* **Prometheus/Grafana**: Monitoring and visualization.
* **ArgoCD**: GitOps-based CD tool.

Kubernetes' architecture separates concerns effectively, allowing powerful, scalable, and maintainable container orchestration.
