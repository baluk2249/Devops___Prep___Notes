# Istio VirtualService

## 1. What is a VirtualService?

A **VirtualService** in Istio defines the rules that control how requests for a service are routed within the service mesh.

It lets you:

* Control traffic routing dynamically without changing service code.
* Implement A/B testing, canary deployments, and traffic mirroring.
* Apply retries, timeouts, and fault injection.

## 2. Key Components

* **hosts**: The service name (DNS) this VirtualService applies to.
* **gateways**: List of gateways to which this rule applies (for ingress traffic).
* **http/tcp/tls**: Rules based on the protocol.
* **match**: Conditions for traffic (headers, URI, etc.).
* **route**: Defines the destination service and subset (version).

## 3. Example: Basic Routing

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
```

This routes all traffic to the `reviews` service version v1.

## 4. Example: Canary Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-split
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 10
```

90% of traffic goes to v1, 10% to v2 (canary testing).

## 5. Example: Match Based Routing

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-header-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jane
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
```

This sends user `jane` to `reviews` v2 and others to v1.

## 6. Example: Timeout and Retry

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-timeout
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
    timeout: 5s
    retries:
      attempts: 3
      perTryTimeout: 2s
```

This sets a 5s timeout and 3 retry attempts with 2s per try.

## 7. Example: Fault Injection

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-fault
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - fault:
      delay:
        percentage:
          value: 100
        fixedDelay: 5s
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
```

This delays all traffic to `reviews` by 5 seconds (used for testing resilience).

## 8. Best Practices

* Use subsets with **DestinationRule** to route between versions.
* Monitor and validate changes using metrics and tracing.
* Apply gradual rollout with traffic shifting.
* Test failure scenarios before production.
