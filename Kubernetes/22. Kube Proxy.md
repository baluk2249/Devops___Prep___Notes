# üîÅ Kubernetes kube-proxy

## üìò What is kube-proxy?

`kube-proxy` is a network component that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. It manages network rules and ensures traffic is properly routed to services and pods.

---

## üîç Purpose of kube-proxy

* Handles routing and load-balancing of **Service IPs** to **backend pod IPs**.
* Implements virtual IPs using **iptables**, **ipvs**, or **userspace** modes.
* Ensures service discovery and network communication.

## üß™ Modes of Operation

| Mode      | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Userspace | Legacy mode. kube-proxy listens and forwards traffic manually. Slow and deprecated. |
| iptables  | Default mode. Uses iptables NAT rules to route traffic efficiently.                 |
| IPVS      | Advanced mode using Linux IPVS (IP Virtual Server) for high performance.            |

Check mode:

```bash
ps aux | grep kube-proxy
```

Look for `--proxy-mode`

---

## üîß kube-proxy Architecture

* Runs as a **DaemonSet** on each node.
* Watches Kubernetes Services and Endpoints.
* Maintains routing rules on the node using selected proxy mode.

Check:

```bash
kubectl get daemonset kube-proxy -n kube-system
```

---

## üîÄ How kube-proxy Works (iptables mode)

1. A Service is created with ClusterIP (e.g., `10.96.0.10`).
2. kube-proxy watches Service and Endpoint objects.
3. It adds iptables rules:

   * Match destination IP to service IP.
   * Redirect to one of the backend pod IPs (round-robin).
4. Kernel handles packet forwarding to pods.

Example:

```bash
kubectl get svc nginx-service
```

```
NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      PORT(S)        AGE
nginx-service   ClusterIP   10.96.0.10      80/TCP         3m
```

```bash
iptables -t nat -L -n | grep 10.96.0.10
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Example: Test kube-proxy functionality

1. Deploy backend app and service

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

2. Access from another pod:

```bash
kubectl run testbox --rm -i -t --image=busybox -- sh
wget -qO- nginx-service
```

3. Check which pod served the request:

```bash
kubectl logs <nginx-pod-name>
```

## üìä kube-proxy Logs and Troubleshooting

Check logs:

```bash
kubectl logs -n kube-system -l k8s-app=kube-proxy
```

Common issues:

| Issue                             | Fix                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Service not reachable             | Check if endpoints are ready (`kubectl get endpoints`) |
| IPs not reachable                 | Check iptables rules (`iptables -t nat -L`)            |
| Network policies blocking traffic | Check `NetworkPolicy` rules                            |

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

* Prefer **IPVS mode** for better scalability and performance.
* Monitor kube-proxy resource usage.
* Use **readiness probes** to avoid routing to unavailable pods.
* Audit `iptables` rules during debugging.
* Ensure CNI plugin compatibility with kube-proxy.
