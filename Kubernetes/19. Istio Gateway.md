# Istio Gateway: Detailed Notes

## 1. What is a Gateway?

An **Istio Gateway** describes a load balancer for HTTP/TCP traffic and operates at the edge of the mesh to manage inbound/outbound traffic.

* Works similar to Kubernetes Ingress but offers more control.
* Configured separately from VirtualService.
* Handles TLS termination, custom ports, and L7 routing.

## 2. Key Components

* **selector**: Labels selecting the Envoy proxy workload (usually `istio-ingressgateway`).
* **servers**: Defines the ports and protocols exposed (HTTP, HTTPS, etc.).
* **hosts**: Hostnames for routing (wildcards supported).

## 3. Basic Example

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: my-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use istio's ingress gateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "myapp.example.com"
```

This creates a gateway that listens on port 80 for HTTP traffic to `myapp.example.com`.

## 4. HTTPS Gateway Example (TLS Termination)

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: my-https-gateway
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 443
      name: https
      protocol: HTTPS
    tls:
      mode: SIMPLE
      credentialName: my-tls-cert # refers to a secret with certs
    hosts:
    - "secure.example.com"
```

This gateway listens on port 443 and terminates TLS for `secure.example.com`.

## 5. Combine with VirtualService

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: myapp-vs
spec:
  hosts:
  - "myapp.example.com"
  gateways:
  - my-gateway
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: myapp
        port:
          number: 80
```

This binds the VirtualService to the `my-gateway`, routing HTTP traffic to the `myapp` service.

## 6. Best Practices

* Use HTTPS with valid TLS certificates.
* Secure your gateways from unwanted open access.
* Avoid wildcard hostnames in production unless needed.
* Always bind VirtualService with the right gateway.
* Use `istioctl analyze` to validate Gateway and VirtualService configuration.
